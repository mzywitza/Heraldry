What is Heraldry?
-----------------

Heraldry is a network application that accepts text input from users. These messages are stored in a database and distributed in realtime to other users.

Heraldry was developed as a tool for an IT operations department. Changes needed to be logged for auditing purposes and the other staff must be informed of those changes. Heraldry combines these two requirements.

How is Heraldry build?
----------------------

Heraldry uses asynchronous messaging for exchanging the methods. The messages are transported via Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ). This allows a client to go offline and get the messages when it is back online.

Storing messages in a database and distributing them among the clients is the responsibility of a server process. All clients send their messages to the server. The messages are stored in a database by the server and are then distributed to the other clients using a Publish/Subscribe pattern.

Which technology is used?
-------------------------

Heraldry uses three main technologies:

1. Messaging is implemented with NServiceBus, a configurable service bus for .Net that builds upon MSMQ and exposes a simple yet powerful API over it.
2. Database access is done with Castle ActiveRecord which is an ORM framework built upon the well-known NHibernate ORM.
3. GUIs are implemented in WPF, which allows rich, customizable graphical interfaces.
